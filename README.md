# My Virtual Assistant

# About

This project mimics a virtual assistant and guides the user through a series of tasks to educate them about the consequences of using Google Services and of linking your Google account to third-party apps that can access your data.

Google claims that employees do not read your data such as emails and documents. However, they have clearly stated that their automated systems do. Even if you aren't bothered by the idea of machines gathering and analyzing your personal data, Google's system still gives third-party apps freedom to use your data in almost any way that they wish. For more info, take a look at the resources at the end of this README.
